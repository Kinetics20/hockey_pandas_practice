# **Hockey Data Analysis with Pandas** 🏒📊  

This repository contains data analysis exercises based on publicly available hockey player statistics from the NHL and WHA leagues, provided by Yahoo. The dataset includes historical player records from the inception of these leagues.  

## **Overview**  
Using Jupyter Notebook, I explored and processed the data primarily with Pandas. The main focus was on mastering essential DataFrame operations, including:  

- **Data preparation** – cleaning and structuring tables for analysis.  
- **Merging datasets** – applying various `merge` configurations.  
- **Pivot tables** – reshaping data using `pivot` and other transformations.  

## **File Storage**  
Processed data was saved in **PKL (Pickle)** format, a binary serialization format widely used in Python. Pickle efficiently stores and loads complex data structures and is compatible with languages in the C family.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** 🐼  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒
